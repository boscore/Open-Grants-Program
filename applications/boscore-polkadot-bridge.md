## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

BOSCore is broadening the scope of the project through an adaptive IBC design and principle, BOSCore can build bridge chains to other networks and to progress this BOSCore is exploring an open grant from the Web 3 Foundation to bridge the IBC EOSIO network with the Polkadot network. The aim is to build a Parachain Bridge. The Bridge will provide a relay between Polkadot and EOSIO Networks. 

The proposed Bridge Chain would enable bidirectional messaging via a hosted Parachain on the Polkadot network. There are several benefits to the approach, extending integration, to form more interoperability and standards of operation for the blockchain industry as a whole, we feel this would bring features and functionality that would be beneficial to our respective communities and ecosystem.

BOSCore project is an open-source blockchain project that pays close attention to the needs of developers and users, since 2019, BOSCore has achieved development milestones to build a custom implementation of the EOSIO codebase while maintaining compatibility with the main branch of EOSIO. 

Our original [IBC principle and design](https://github.com/boscore/Documentation/blob/master/IBC/EOSIO_IBC_Priciple_and_Design.md) will be modified to include relevant details for this project to make a more general principle design for enabling bidirectional messaging via a hosted Parachain on the Polkadot network. There are several benefits to the approach that extends integration to form more interoperability and standards of operation. 

To further advance our codebase, we developed Batch PBFT, a consensus algorithm achieving block finality speeds of 3-second and benchmarking 50 times faster with an insignificant overhead when compared to the default EOSIO consensus.

Since then, we have enabled the IBC systems HUB protocol and linked four public EOSIO based chains (BOSCore, EOS, Telos, and WAX), this allows the transfer of system and custom tokens along with transaction memo data over the network. This functionality enables application developers to build and deploy multi-chain DApps. 

We see advancements and innovation taking place in the ecosystem, that can lead to greater interoperability between different networks, and are keen to build a bridge linking EOSIO based parallel chains with Polkadot Parachains. Extending the functionality of bosibc.io so developers building multi-chain DApps can port their applications and leverage a more decentralized user-base spanning connected networks.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 

* What work has been done so far?  
Milestone 1 is completed with the submission of this application and publication of a medium article describing the open application for the project. 
* Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?  
There are no teams who have already contributed to the project financially. 
* Have you applied for other grants so far?  
No other grants have been applied for this project
* Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?  
Yes, there are other bridge chain projects focused on staking and linking to other networks such as Cosmos, Ethereum, EOS, and Tendermint.  In contrast, this project-specific focus is on establishing interoperability. Having already established interoperability between four public chains (BOSCore, EOS, Telos, and Wax) you can experience BOSIBC today.  Extending this existing connectivity with a bridge to the Polkadot network would benefit the whole ecosystem, including other projects in development. Network interoperability, by definition, is communicating and working together.   
* The team's long-term plans and intentions with this project.  
Long term plans are to progress the project through the development and adoption of protocol standards that lead to unprecedented scalability for the development of blockchain-related digital economies.
